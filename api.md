## Getting started
`inertia.js` is a module packaging, and sharing software. It's goal is to modularize chunks of code for easy updating and upgrading of software. I developed it for quick and sweet programming without having to search or create some crucial tools. 

#### Download
Depending on the module package you which to use, go into the compile folder, open and copy the code from the module compiled file (it has all the dependencies already there for use, to get a better understanding of each module read further).

#### Usage
`Inertia.js` can be called by using this:  
```javascript
$in.mgr.ready(function () {
    /* code here */
}).loop(100);
```
